# 🧠 Image Captioning & Generation with Bidirectional LSTM

This project demonstrates a **bidirectional deep learning system** that can:

✅ Generate natural-language captions from input images  
✅ Generate relevant images from given textual captions  

It combines a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for feature extraction and a **Bidirectional LSTM** for language understanding/generation.
The result is a dual-capable system that bridges vision and language in both directions. 
A bidirectional vision-language model that generates captions from images and retrieves or generates images from captions, using ViT-GPT2 with Hugging Face Transformers.
